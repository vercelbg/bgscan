## Overview

**bgscan** is a terminal-based multi-protocol network scanner written in Go. It probes IP addresses across ICMP, TCP, HTTP, DNS, and Xray protocols and chains scan stages into pipelines — all through an interactive keyboard-driven TUI.

Use it for host discovery, port scanning, web service testing, DNS resolver analysis, tunneling detection, and Xray proxy validation. Results are saved to disk and can be re-scanned, so you can run a broad ICMP sweep and then drill down with TCP or HTTP on whatever responded.

The scanner is built for developers and researchers who need speed, flexibility, and a modern terminal experience without leaving the keyboard.

## Features

**Scanning engine**

- **Multi-protocol probes** — ICMP, TCP, HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3 (QUIC), TLS, DNS, DNSTT, Slipstream, and Xray
- **Pipeline chaining** — chain stages (e.g. ICMP → TCP → HTTP) with Stream, Sequential, or Batch execution modes
- **Concurrent workers** — configurable per-probe worker pools for parallel scanning
- **Shuffle & sample** — randomize target order and cap the number of IPs to scan

**Terminal UI**

- **BubbleTea TUI** — fully keyboard-driven; scan, monitor, and manage results without a browser
- **Live scan dashboard** — tabbed progress bars and result tables per pipeline stage
- **In-app settings inspector** — edit every configuration field interactively; changes save to disk immediately
- **Theme support** — dark/light/auto palettes (Catppuccin-based)

**Data & I/O**

- **Save & replay** — results are written to CSV and can be used as input for new scans
- **Bundled IP lists** — ships with Cloudflare, AWS, Azure, Google, Akamai, Fastly, Bunny, G-Core, and Iran ranges
- **Xray outbound manager** — add outbounds from share links or JSON files, then validate and speed-test them

**Reliability**

- **Crash-safe result writer** — atomic merge with `fsync` and temp-file rename; constant memory
- **Log rotation** — three log streams (core, UI, debug) with 50 MB rotation, 3 backups, 7-day retention
- **Startup health checks** — validates config, locates optional binaries, and warns instead of crashing when something is missing

---

## Why bgscan?

- **One tool, full chain.** Most scanners do one protocol well. bgscan chains them: ping a range, connect to survivors, HTTP-probe the open ports — in a single run.
- **Pipeline-agnostic engine.** The engine doesn't know what probes do. It feeds IPs, collects results, and flushes to disk. Adding a new scan type means implementing a three-method `Probe` interface and registering a stage builder.
- **No runtime clutter.** ICMP, TCP, and HTTP probes use the Go standard library. Xray, DNSTT, and Slipstream are optional external binaries validated at startup — missing ones log a warning and disable only their scan type.
- **File-first configuration.** All settings live in plain TOML. The in-app inspector reads and writes the same files, so what you see in the TUI is what's on disk.
- **Built for the terminal.** Keyboard navigation, overlay dialogs, live progress, streaming logs — no browser, no Electron, no web server.

## Installation

### Quick install

**Linux / macOS / Termux**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MohsenBg/bgscan/refs/heads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MohsenBg/bgscan/refs/heads/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Android (Termux)**

```bash
pkg update -y && pkg install bash curl unzip -y
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MohsenBg/bgscan/refs/heads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

The installer detects your platform, downloads the latest release, extracts it to `bgscan/`, and makes the binary executable. On re-run it detects an existing install and offers to replace it or back it up.

### Manual install

1. Download the ZIP for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/MohsenBg/bgscan/releases/latest).
2. Extract the archive.
3. Run the binary:
   - **Linux / macOS / Termux:** `./bgscan`
   - **Windows:** `bgscan.exe`

The first run creates a `settings/` directory with default TOML config and an `ips/` directory with bundled IP lists.

### Build from source

bgscan uses a companion builder tool (`bgscan-builder`) to fetch platform-specific dependencies (Xray, DNSTT, Slipstream binaries) and build the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohsenBg/bgscan.git
cd bgscan

# Install the builder tool
# Linux / macOS:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MohsenBg/bgscan/refs/heads/main/scripts/install-builder.sh | bash
# Windows (PowerShell):
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MohsenBg/bgscan/refs/heads/main/scripts/install-builder.ps1 | iex

# Fetch dependencies for your platform
# Linux / macOS:
./scripts/install-deps.sh
# Windows:
./scripts/install-deps.ps1

# Build and run
go run ./cmd/bgscan/
```

For release builds targeting a specific platform:

```bash
./bgscan-builder release -os linux -arch amd64
./bgscan-builder release -os windows -arch amd64
./bgscan-builder release -os darwin -arch arm64
```

> **Note:** bgscan cannot be installed via `go install` because it requires platform-specific external binaries (Xray, DNSTT, Slipstream). Use the builder tool or the quick install script.

---

## Quick Start

1. Launch bgscan from your installation folder (`./bgscan` on Unix, `bgscan.exe` on Windows).
2. Select **Run Scan** and press `Enter`.
3. Choose a target source — **IP List** (from your imported files) or **Result List** (from a previous scan).
4. Pick a scan type — ICMP, TCP, HTTP, DNS, or Xray.
5. Press `Enter` to start. Progress and results stream live in the dashboard.
6. Open **Result Files** from the main menu to review, rename, or delete saved results.

| Key | Navigation |
|:---:|-------------|
| `↑` `↓` | Move between items |
| `Enter` | Select / start |
| `b` or `Esc` | Go back |
| `q` | Quit |

## Documentation

Full documentation is available at:

- **Homepage:** https://mohsenbg.github.io/bgscan
- **Full docs:** https://mohsenbg.github.io/bgscan/docs

The documentation covers:

- **Quick Start** — installation, launch, and first scan
- **Scanner** — scan types, scan sources, IP lists, result files, scan pipeline, Xray outbounds
- **Settings** — every TOML config file explained: general, writer, ICMP, TCP, HTTP, DNS, Xray, and the in-app inspector
- **Logs** — three log streams, the log viewer, and rotation policy
- **Developer** — architecture, core (engine, probes, config, results), UI (component model, layout, theming), contributing guide, and build instructions

---

## Configuration

All configuration lives in plain TOML files in the `settings/` directory next to the binary:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `general_settings.toml` | Pipeline mode, max IPs, batch size, shuffle, status interval |
| `writer_settings.toml` | Result buffering, flush interval, channel and batch size |
| `icmp_settings.toml` | ICMP timeout, retries, workers |
| `tcp_settings.toml` | TCP port, timeout, retries, workers |
| `http_settings.toml` | HTTP/HTTPS/HTTP3 version, TLS range, accepted status codes |
| `dns_settings.toml` | DNS resolver, DNSTT, and Slipstream tuning |
| `xray_settings.toml` | Xray connectivity test type, speed test, pre-scan |

Edit files manually or use the in-app inspector — both write to the same files. The inspector saves changes immediately to disk without restarting. See the [Settings documentation](https://mohsenbg.github.io/bgscan/docs/settings/) for every field.

---

## Example Usage

**Scan a bundled IP list**

After launching, select **Run Scan → IP List → cloudflare_IPv4**, then choose a scan type (e.g. `t` for TCP). bgscan scans the list with the configured workers and writes results to `result/tcp/`.

**Chain ICMP → TCP → HTTP**

In `general_settings.toml`, set `pipeline_mode = "streaming"`. If multiple scan types are enabled, their stages chain automatically — only IPs that pass each stage's success criteria proceed to the next.

**Re-scan a previous result**

Select **Run Scan → Result List** and pick a saved result file. bgscan re-scans only the IPs in that file, useful for deeper analysis on hosts that already passed an earlier stage.

**Xray outbound validation**

From the main menu, open **Xray → Outbounds**, press `a` to add a template from a share link (`vless://`, `vmess://`, `trojan://`, `ss://`, `hysteria2://`, `wireguard://`) or a JSON file. Then run an Xray scan to test connectivity and bandwidth.
